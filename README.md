Analyzing Health Insurance Market Data
Exploratory Data Analysis of Health Insurance Data
In this project, I had explored bigger data of around 12 million records, and look into other ways to perform EDA in Python. The dataset used contains data on health and dental plans offered to individuals and small businesses through the US Health Insurance Marketplace. It was originally prepared and released by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) and was subsequently published on Kaggle.
